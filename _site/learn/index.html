          <h2>The Issue</h2>
          <p>Food insecurity is the most broadly-used measure of food deprivation in the United States. The USDA defines food insecurity as meaning “consistent access to adequate food is limited by a lack of money and other resources at times during the year.”</p>

<p>Food insecurity is most prevalent in households containing children, disabled individuals or the elderly. Every Texas county is touched by the struggle to afford enough food.</p>
