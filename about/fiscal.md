Feeding Texas is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization recognized by the State of Texas and the Internal Revenue Service. 

We maintain trusted, contractual partnerships with the following state agencies: Texas Health and Human Services Commission, Texas Department of Agriculture, Texas Department of Criminal Justice and Texas Division of Emergency Management. 

We receive support from respected, national anti-hunger organizations including Feeding America, the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) and Mazon. 

As a statewide association, most of our annual budget is distributed directly to regional food banks to assist them in providing food and services locally.
