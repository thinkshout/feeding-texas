Some of the most important resources to fight hunger in Texas are public investments like SNAP (aka food stamps), school meals and summer meals for children.

TFBN works with decision-makers at the state and federal levels to protect and improve these investments as part of our campaign to end hunger in Texas. We provide research, expertise and a unique perspective to public debates on many issues affecting food security, nutritional health and broader food policy.

At the state level, TFBN is a founding member of the Texas Food Policy Roundtable, a forum coordinating the advocacy of dozens of organizations on food-related issues.

At the federal level, TFBN is a respected contributor to the national debate, and a trusted partner of national groups including Feeding America, the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
