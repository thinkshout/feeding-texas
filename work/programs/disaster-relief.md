TFBN is proud to maintain a formal partnership with  the Texas Division of Emergency Management and FEMA in responding to emergencies like hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires.

Through this partnership TFBN provides food, water and other forms of support to disaster victims as outlined in the State of Texas Emergency Management Plan. The program began in the early 1990’s, when the Texas Association of Second Harvest Food Banks (TFBN’s former name) developed a state disaster plan based on similar plans in Florida and Louisiana.

TFBN food banks acted in partnership with first responders following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, Hurricane Ike in 2008, and the Bastrop wildfires in 2011.
